# Kickstarting with Excel Project

## Overview of Project
To know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Purpose
The Purpose of this was to help Louise identify what other campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. In order to help Louise I analyzed the data set using  four major components that can be used as a a primary foucs for this analysis. Number one was to find the avaerage amount of funding other plays had listed as a goal. Number two was to look at the amount of funds that were actually given for the plays in the data set. Number three was to see of the plays had a successful outcome by reaching there funding goals. Number four was to look and see if there were any differences with the launch date and its impact on its successfulness for the play. Thus giving Louise a better picture to what would be needed in order for her to in prove her funding for her campaign.   

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In this graph the data displayed shows the x-axis with the month and the y-axis with the total number of campaigns for that month. The graph also highlights if the campain was either successful,canceled, failed, or live for that month. With in this data set it shows that in a span of a year there had been more successful theater outcomes. It also highlights how a certian month may have an impact on a success of a campaign which shows the ideal month to start funding for a play. Staring from April - September there was was a high rate of sucessful plays funded than from Janurary - March or October - December.   

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This data is displayed showing how the plays did based on their funding goals for the play. It demonstrates that the higher the funding the higher rate of failure campaigns had. The dip in successful outcomes based on goals starts from the range of $10,000 to about $35,000 where a large number of goals begin to drop their success rates. The graph does show that their low budget goals that had a high rate of success based on funding goals. This range of successful outcomes based on goal started at less than $1,000 - $10,000 mark, there is a limitation how Louise can use this information. She can use this information to show possible funders that her asking funding goal can yield a successful outcome. However, the graph does not show the genre of plays that were successful or which funding campaigns based on location had more of a successful outcome. To better improve the rate of success an ideal location should be pin pointed in order to best analyze the rate of success of a plays funding. By having the data on which location or country has higher successful outcomes based on funding goal would vastly improve the successfulness of the campaign. While also including which genre type of the play that has a higher funding rate in the shortest time would aid in future play success. Although Louises funding campaign was funded for $2,485 the genre may have impacted its failure, in the future having data about successful genres and locations for a play may lead to having a higher succesful campaign in the future. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
