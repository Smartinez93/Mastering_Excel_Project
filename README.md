# Kickstarting with Excel Project

## Overview of Project
To know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
### Purpose
The Purpose of this was to help Louise identify what other campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. In order to help Louise I analyzed the data set using  four major components that can be used as a a primary foucs for this analysis. Number one was to find the avaerage amount of funding other plays had listed as a goal. Number two was to look at the amount of funds that were actually given for the plays in the data set. Number three was to see of the plays had a successful outcome by reaching there funding goals. Number four was to look and see if there were any differences with the launch date and its impact on its successfulness for the play. Thus giving Louise a better picture to what would be needed in order for her to in prove her funding for her campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
